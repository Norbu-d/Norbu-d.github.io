### Topic : ER Diagram Representation
---

In this topic this a daigram focused on relationship between entities and attributes and its dependence to each other.

entities are known as independent existence and it can be object or physicall existence and attributes are known to describe entities.

example an entities can student and its attribute can roll number,class,age as it describes students attributes and student is an independet existence.

there are two types of attributes which is composite attributes which can be divided further, example names has first name, middle name, last name , secondly it is simple attribute which cannot be devided further , example weight cannot be divided further.

There are also derived attributes which can be derived from other attributes as age can derived to date of birth.

Secondly stored attribute where the attibute is derived example from date of birth we can derive age.

There is a special attribute which is capable of identifying each entity uniquely .
example student number of our college as it is unique for identifying students differently.

IN class we were taught about er diagram about entities and its relationship and then seperated in group to create Er diagram on given group Er diagram.

There was 6 groups and each had to create thier own Er diagram own thier respective topics so each group taught us thier learning prespective and thier group works as so did  we do our teachings giving us more information to creating Er diagram .

To improve flip class better i would like to have 3 hours class as 4 hours is to burden sometimes and gets sleepy for it to be to long.
