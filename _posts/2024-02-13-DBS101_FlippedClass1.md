### Topic : Database Users and Database Adminstrators
---

I learned that database topic it self means mangaing data of users which are secured for thier privacy from unauthorized access.

Database Administratoin are composed of cycle called r life cycle which follows the steps of database adminstrators .

Cycle goes planing-->analysis-->design-->implement-->Mantian-->update.

1.Planing goes as first planing how the database are required by the stakeholders and then plan on the next steps of cycle as planing a plan is important in the first step.

2.Analysis is to determine how to manage the database to the systems new requirements .

3.Design is the stage where onr must locate the individual data in individual sets as to go thruogh different types of data .

4.implementations is the access to data as different business have different privacy data so to access it needs strict authorization to secure private data.

5.Maintenacnce is the word simply checking for problems in database system .

7.Upadate is the word that means changing the database to addd new data or removing a data.

The functions of Database Adminstrator is to secure the data to keeep privacy and meeets the end meets of stake holders and keeping a good realtionship and to also check the problem of system and ensuring the database are omptimized and efficient for the users to use.

There are 8 types of Database users :
1.Database Administrator (DBA) is a team or person which can give access to users for authorzation as they are to maintain the security of the database.

2.Parametic End users are users who frequently use DBMS and have less knowleadge on DBMS, Example: boking ticket.

3.system Analyst are user who check the satisfactory of users as like taking feedbacks.

4.Sophisticated Users are users who has knowledge on database and dont use code but use SQL querries.

5.Database Designers are users who are the ones to locate the indiavidual data in individual dataset like in table or taps.

6.Application Programmers are users who are the ones doing the coding as they are professional .

7.Casual Users are users who occasionaly acces data but need new information.

8.Specialized Users are experts but they do not follow the tradional code but code themsleves as they are professinal.

In flipped class we were made in sets of group and made to discuss on database adminstrator and share our knowledge going to differnet group and also learning the knowledge of other group,  after discussion we were going through question and answer with madam.

To improve flipped classs i would like if we could go to practical coding on database in class as i dont know coding much and my carrer runs thruogh coding and would like to not get to watch online vedios doing slef study but get actual coding in class to get more improvement.
