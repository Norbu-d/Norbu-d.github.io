## 1.Ranking 

It certianly means ranking as the term ranking means just like to rank our marks or status to see in comparision with others.


as first i created a new database and made players and score so to rank them .


i created a new table called ranked_players so i can rank them with code from where i selected from my previous table id,player,score and made the score go in accending order so i can rank them.

## 2.windowing

 window function produces a result for each query row.\


 as the picture shows there is two region north and south and it made it into rowing the same region together to who the running_tool and amount .

 this retrives data from the sales table, calculates the running total of sales amount for each region, and orders the result set by region and sale date.

 ## 3.pivoting

 Pivoting is a process used in databases, spreadsheets, and data analysis tools to transform data from a long format to a wide format.

 Pivoting is particularly useful for summarizing and presenting data.

 as the above image it shows that the amount for north has been combined and shown directly as janurary sales and same for south beacause of pivoting as it directly gives us summarization of data as to total amount .

## 4.rollup and cube

 ROLLUP creates subtotals at any level of aggregation needed, from the most detailed up to a grand total. CUBE is an extension similar to ROLLUP , enabling a single statement to calculate all possible combinations of subtotals. CUBE can generate the information needed in cross-tab reports with a single query.

 this is rollup as it calculates the total sales amount by region and product, along with subtotals for each region and a grand total across all regions and products.

 this is cube as it it calculates the total sales amount by region and product, generating summaries for each combination of region and product, along with subtotals for individual regions, products, and a grand total.

 both rollup and cube give grand total which is thier similarities.

 In class we were made into groups and we discussed our topic rank and presented in the class for how the ranking work in sql and then came forwarded by the next groups with thier topic giving us new information form thier discoveries.

 i would like madam to give us more time durring practical assignments as it was really hard to do mrs practical for we dont know how to psql in professional level and have to learn and for that we need more time during practical assugnments as making voting database and doing the task were totdally differnt from what i had to apply from mrs class and we get assingments for other subjects.
