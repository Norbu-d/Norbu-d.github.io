## Nmap scan

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175456.png>)

First of all i started my work with nmap scan to find the open port that are available for the ip address and as the result i got 6 open ports and now that I know that there are 6 open ports i can know which ports that can be attacked.

Nmap is important as we could take the example as to find the location to where we want to go but we need map so that we can scan the map to find our destination and the same goes for namp scan to find which port to attack as we can find the open port.

The above picture is the namp scaned in the DSA wifi which had 6 ports opened.

The Abpve picture is the nmap scaned in the ICT wifi which had 24 ports open and i had no idea it had this much port open until the last day as we had to sit outside and do our work.

In nmap there are many types of way we can scan and my scan is simple as -O is to scan the operating system and if i want to scan in a stealthy mode i can use the scan code in three way handshake as "-sS -SV" as this doesn't make get found that i scanned the network and makes it stealthy beacause of three way handshake. 

TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection. The connection is full duplex, and both sides synchronize (SYN) and acknowledge (ACK) each other. The exchange of these four flags is performed in three steps.

## Meatasploit

Metasploit is a powerful tool used by  networks security professionals to do penetration test,by system administrators to test patch installations.

Metasploit codes are simple to run as we can find the information of the file or device and change its ports,lhost,rhost to our desired wish which makes it exploiting easy.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180212.png>)

we can also search the exploitable files just like the above picture which shows the advantage of metasploit but the down side is that we get lots of output so it is harder to find.

To solve this type of problem we have to reasearch the device and ports so we find the related files that we need to exploit for the specific device.

Like the reasearch is found that the device is run in linux and has apche version 3.2.8 and it can found through nmap scan and to be ethical hacker we must fisrt reasearch before testing .

I used search php_cgi which is in the port of http and i got the Running PHP as a CGI means that you basically tell your web server the location of the PHP executable file, and the server runs that executable, giving it the script you called, each time you visit a page.

And out of all the file in the http the file php_cgi is exploitable as i can change the rhost to the target host as the code set rhost “the target ip address” which is 10.3.21.140 and also setting the port to the http port which was found in the nmap scan.

And after setting the rhost and the lport we can see if it is changed by using info or options which will show the system information.


![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175416.png>)

These are the settings current settings and descriptions for the file.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175438.png>)

After everything is set up i can execute the code run or exploit which will run the metasploit code execution to exploit the file or get into the file .

And to check if we are inside i can run the code whoami which shows www-data but i am not root access so i run the code /usr/bin/nmap –interactive to get interactive mode as the nmap scanned to the file and makes the console interactive and to get root access i execute the code nmap> !sh to get to the root access  when i run whoami i am given output root .

After getting the root access i can see the files in it by running the code ls to get list of file as shown in the above.

### Metasploit for postgres port 


![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175630.png>)

The above picture is for the port 5432 which we found in the namp scan as open port and in the metasploit console i researched about the postgres information to exploit and from the reference from the youtube vedio i found that there exist a directory called postgres_playload which is exploitable and searched it.

From what i learned from metasploit the most important way is the change the current setting to get exploitabl way to get in the machine.

After using this file we can see the information where it says in its description that it contains dictionary and we can see that in the current setting that there is not RHOST and LHOST so we must set the LHOST and RHOST to exploit the file.

The RHOST is our target mahcines ip address and the LHOST is our ip address machine and it should be filled so that we can get access to the machine.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175642.png>)

So we set the RHOST and LHOST to as the RHOST is the target ip address 10.3.21.140 and LHOST is our ip address for our device which can be found using the command ifconfig and the steps are same like the one we did for the http to get root access.

As we can see that we have gained root access and we can pretty much see the list of files or upload after getting root priviledge.

### Metasploit for ssh port 

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180006.png>)

So we searched ssh_login beacause we know that it has a password and username and to crack it we can use bruteforce way to crack it and get root access and it is also exploitable as it gives us login logs.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180024.png>)

As it said it will give me ssh login database if i exploit it so it is a good sytem to hack.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-07%20005055.png>)

first i must create a nano users.txt to get into the machine so that i can brute force my way into it to crack the password and username by filling the USER_FILE and PASS_File into users.txt.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180046.png>)

Now i have to fill in the blank that are in the current setting like RHOST that is the target ip and VERBOSE which is optional as i want to change it to true so that i can get output of my brute force if it is succesful or unsuccesful and also STOP ON SUCCESS true so that it can stop the brute force if it is success.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180055.png>)

I have also set the USER_FILE and PASS_FILE into path of my users.txt so that it can brute force its way into the machine by trying out diffferent combinations of passwords and username.

![alt text](./Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180105.png>)

this is the output when i run as it is bruteforcing into to the machine by trying out different combinations.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180131.png>)

After getting into the machine by brute forcing and getting privilledge i can create a session so that i can get root privilidge into the system and the above picture shows my root priviledge to the sytem as now i can see the files and add files .

### MY SQL for port 3306

MYSQL port are most common for the database system and it can have sensitive data information as if it can get accesed we can easily see the persons database information such as his phone number and id number which can be thiers private details.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175727.png>)

first i search mysql_login in the search as to get the login dictionaries and found it is exploitablae.


For this same step to metasploit steps i have done so far but in here i can get the password and username and i would like to apologize i have got the wrong screenshot and forgot to screenshot to the correct one where i did the password cracking


![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180046.png>)


The step is the same as i have to fill the empty space like Rhost and lport and lhost and to get the password for the above i used USER_FILE and PASS_FILE but it failed as it could not get passed.

But to get the correct way the password is giving the file rockyou.txt as this rockyou.txt contains millions of passwords which are used frequently by users and users.txt which also contains the frequent username used so i set these two files in the command instead user_file and pass_file as it brute forces by trying different combinations of users and password to crack the password and username as this files needs username and password to get access.

I am sorry could not upload the image as i forgot to screenshot and screenshot the wrong one.

### Metasplolit exploit for irc for port 6667 

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180231.png>)

For the above we opened metasploit console and we are using nmap scan to find the version to get the better search.

the nmap scan we are doing is aggresive scan into the port where the output given is the version of the irc as unreal which we we can use in search.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180240.png>)

as we can see we got the unreal version for the irc which is backdoor for the irc port.

A backdoor is an undocumented way to bypass existing cybersecurity measures and gain access to the computer system or device.

So since this file is exploitable we use this file.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180255.png>)

The above are the information for the file and we can see there is not much to set for the current setting.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180308.png>)

we can also see the payload but for us its no use but i just demonstrated the payload files as it is not neccessary to set the payload for the current setting as it is not shown.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20180308.png>)

the only thing to set for the machine is RhOST which is our target host or the target ip address 10.3.21.140 and use exploit or run but for reason it didnt work for me as the host just went down when i was working on it so the exploit could not work.

## php inoformation

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175654.png>)

The above are the information and the security that sir used for the machine and there are even more details of php systems that are used in this CAP1.

PHP is a self-referentially acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. Original it supposedly meant personal home page. It is an open source, server-side, HTML embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages.

Advantages of Using PHP in Web Development
Performance. PHP scripting language is executed faster than scripts written in other coding languages such as ASP and JSP. ...
Open-Source. ...
Familiarity with the Syntax. ...
Embedded. ...
Platform Independent. ...
Database Support. ...
Error Reporting. ...
Loosely Typed Language.


## Reverse Shell 


A reverse shell attack is a type of cyberattack where a threat actor establishes a connection from a target machine (the victim's) to their machine. Reverse shell attacks are often executed via TCP and, in rare cases, ICMP or UDP.

We also did this reverse shell type of hack in the TOP10OWSAP assignment and it establihsed the network to the device.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-07%20095631.png>)

The fist thing i did was download a php-reverse-shell.php file from the git hub and made changed the ip address inside with my ip address and changed the port 4444 so that i can get the reading for port 4444 in the end.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175515.png>)

After running the code for the reverse shell it still didnt get any reading for the port 4444 but showed a failure and failed to established a direct netwerk for the http:link as given and for some reason i dont know why it didnt work for the reverse shell for it to give a warning maybe it is beacause of the sirs securtiy.

### Bruteforcing into the HTTP

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-07%20101617.png>)

As we can see that Sir used phpMyadmin for the login but we have no deatails for the username or the password and based on my observation i found out that there is no limitation of users and passwords that i can use and the above is token system based on.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175848.png>)

The above shows the cheat sheet to brute force into the Authentication of phpMyAdmin for the website to bypass by trying out different combination.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175712.png>)

This is the output when I tried to use the cheat for phpMyadmin from the github which is below the picture where I tried to brute force into it as there is no limitation to how much username and the password I can use .

I tried both the codes but it gave the same result as Internal Service Error .
First link :  python3 main.py -url http://example.com/pma/ -user root -pdict password.txt
Second link : python3 main.py -url http://example.com/pma/ -udict users.txt -pdict password.txt

I guess the code could not be read so it gave the error.

## Hydra

Hydra is a command-line tool to guess valid pairs of usernames and passwords. Unlike John the Ripper, an offline password cracker, Hydra is geared towards online applications, making it suitable for web-based penetration testing. Like its many-headed namesake, Hydra targets many services as a password cracker.

Hydra can be used to not only brute force against commonly used network protocols, such as SSH, FTP and RDP, but also to conduct brute-force attacks against web applications.

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175755.png>)

The above image shows how the hydra command is used and i used hydra command to crack the username and password for 10.3.21.140/phpMyadmin the above image is from a youtube vedio that they taught me adn the topic was to crack the username and the password for the same type of website in the hackthebox.io room. 

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175806.png>)

![alt text](</Screenshot%202024-05-06%20175824.png>)

After running the hydra code for the link for the phpMyadmin i got different passwords and none of them worked and i couldnt understand why.

I got different passwords for each command I executed again and again and couldn't get the right passwords. 

To run this command i need to have usernames-shortlist.txt and rockyou.txt as it tries out different sets of combinations in brute force way but it failed for me and I would like sir to teach this topic as this is a big question mark topic for me.

And the way i got the phpMyadmin by running the code 
gobuster dir -10.3.21.140 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
Which shows the http link that are available to use like twiki and phpMyadmin and others and i am once again sorry as some of the pictures were deleted as I switched to full kali linux as some metasploit command were not working in the vm ware .

And the way i knew that there were websites open was because while doing nmap scan i found that http and tcp ports were open which shows that it is a webserver.


## Conclusion

The best tool I used was metasploit and the disadvantage is Metasploit can be noisy and easily detected by security solutions, making it difficult to establish persistence on compromised systems. Additionally, it can be unstable and unreliable, especially when dealing with complex or dynamic environments.

I saw how sir found out how many had root access to the device and it was because we were all using metasploit and I found metasploit is great for exploiting into open ports as it scan through all the server to find the exploitable file and penetration can take place.

I learned that nmap scan is really important to scan the network as it shows us the ways we penetrate through the port by finding which ports are open and we can find the device name and its model which can be used in metasploit to find relatable files.
